        <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried basil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 teapsoon sugar</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>15 oz ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley, chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with non-stick spray or butter.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet or saucepan, brown the ground beef (or sausage) over medium-high heat. Add chopped onions and garlic, cooking until they become translucent and fragrant.</li>
        <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, dried basil, dried oregano, sugar, salt, and pepper. Let the sauce simmer on low heat for about 20-25 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, mix together the ricotta cheese, egg, and half of the grated Parmesan cheese. Add a pinch of salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Now, it's time to assemble the lasagna! Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of the greased baking dish. Arrange a layer of lasagna noodles over the sauce.</li>
        <li>Next, spread a generous layer of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, followed by a layer of shredded mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Repeat the layers: meat sauce, noodles, ricotta mixture, and mozzarella cheese. Continue until all the ingredients are used up, finishing with a layer of meat sauce and a generous sprinkle of mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses on top.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil, ensuring it's tightly sealed to keep the moisture in.</li>
        <li>Bake the lasagna in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Then, remove the foil and continue baking for an additional 20-25 minutes, or until the cheese on top is bubbly and lightly golden.</li>
        <li>Once done, take the lasagna out of the oven and let it rest for a few minutes before serving. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley for a burst of color and freshness.</li>
    </ol>
